<h4>HISTORY</h4>
<p>The cube was invented by Erno Rubik, a hungarian sculptor. His initial goal in designing the cube was finding a way to make the blocks move without the cube falling apart. The cube's made up of 26 smaller cubes, arrange in 3 layers that can twist on 3 axes.</p>

<p>After Rubik's initial attempt involving elsatic bands failed, he hand carved each of the pieces to have the cube hold itself together by shape, marking each side with a different color of adhesive paper. He then realized it was a puzzle when he noticed it wasn't so easy to put the pieces back in their original position. He theorized-correctly-that he would never be able to solve it just by twisting it randomly,  so he started attempting at a solution. He'd solved the puzzle within a month.</p>

<h4>FUN FACTS</h4>
<ul>
    <li>As of writing this, the fastest solve of the Rubik's cube in an official event is 3.47 seconds, held by Yusheng Du.</li>
    
    <li>The largest order Rubik's cube is 33x33x33, made by Gregoire Pfennig in France on 2 December 2017. It's fully functional, with 6153 move-able parts.</li>
    
    <li>There are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different scrambles of a standard rubik's cube, i.e. more than 43 quintillion scrambles.</li>
</ul>

<h4>PARTS OF THE CUBE (NAMES OF THE PIECES)</h4>
<div class="listItem">
    <img class="examples" alt="centers" src="../images/centers.png">
    
    <p>The center: the center piece is the piece in the center of the face. There are 6 of them on the 3b by 3. It only has one color, and it's fixed in its position, so you can't rearrange it.</p>
</div>

<div class="listItem">
    <img class="examples" alt="edges" src="../images/edges.png">
    
    <p>The edges: the edge pieces are the pieces on the sides of the cube. There are 12 of them on the 3 by 3. They have two colors.</p>    
</div>

<div class="listItem">
    <img class="examples" alt="corners" src="../images/corners.png">
    
    <p>The corners: the corner pieces are the pieces on the corners of the cube. There are 8 of them on the 3 by 3. They have 3 colors.</p>
